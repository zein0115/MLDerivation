# MLDerivation

This is a repository including detailed derivation of some machine learning algorithm. Pdf and Tex files are available in each folder. 

## Background

I'm a 1st year (in 2020 summer) undergraduate student majoring BIM. I sometimes got confused in the derivation of ML algorithm (usually the derivation of gradient). Some derivation in original article, is over-simplified, which is difficult to understand. Therefore, I make some detailed derivation that **people with basic knowledge in calculus and linear algebra, etc., could understand**. If you encounter some questions in the derivation or you find some typos and mathematical problems, feel free to email me through clampfun@163.com or contact me on twitter @Haoran0115 (Recommended). The update would not be frequent due to heavy school work.
